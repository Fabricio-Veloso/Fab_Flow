# üöÄ Project-Flow

**Systematic project structure generation + activity tracking + metadata logging for real planning**

---

## üéØ Objective

2. ‚ôªÔ∏è Make it easier and more dynamic to:
    - ‚úÖ Organize and inject **status**, **checkpoints**, and **accomplishments** for activities and projects.
    - ‚è±Ô∏è Track **time investment** on activities in an organized manner.
    - üóÇÔ∏è Log all the above in a **structured** and **easy-to-find** format.
    - üìä Generate **metadata** from this flow for **future planning** and **decision-making**.

## ‚ú® Features

### üß± `Create Project` Command (~~DONE~~)

- Launches modals to capture the **project name** and **scope**, followed by activity definition.
- You must fill in the **area/column name** (e.g., _Documentation_, _Database_, or _Design_).
- Then define the first activity:
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è _Only_ `name` and `type` are **required**.
    - üè∑Ô∏è Name
    - üîß Type (Simple or Complex)
    - üìé Context
    - üîó Files (e.g., relevant links or references)
    - üéØ Objectives
    - üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
- You can then:
    - ‚ûï Add more activities to the column
    - ‚ûï Create a new column
    - üíæ Save and generate the full project structure

#### ‚úÖ Generated Structure Includes:

- üìÅ Folders for:
    - `Scope/`
    - `Active Projects/`
    - `[Project Name]/`
    - `Notes from Cards/` (activity cards)
- üìù A note titled: `ProjectName_h`
    - Acts as the **project header**, containing:
        - Status
        - Files
        - Context
        - Objectives
        - Roadmap
- üóÇÔ∏è A **Kanban board**:
    - Activities appear as **cards** in their respective **columns**
    - Each card links to a note in `"Notes from Cards"` with all filled information
    - [ ] _(Insert screenshot here)_

### üß≠ ‚ÄúLanding Page‚Äù Model (_LPM_) (üìå Rename suggestion pending)

- When opening Obsidian with **Fab-Flow Plugin** enabled:
    - A modal with pending activities appears.
    - Activities can be assigned to **time slots** using a Google Calendar‚Äìstyle interface.
    - Ends with a ‚ÄúStart Realizing‚Äù button (or similar).

---

### üåä Flow State Flux (_FSF_) (üìå Name suggestion pending)

- While executing selected activities, a timer runs in the background.
- ‚å®Ô∏è Hotkeys allow rapid notes that go directly to the `status` field of the activity‚Äôs note.
- ‚èπÔ∏è When the timer ends, FSF halts and waits for next user input.

#### Upon returning to FSF:

- **If return is quick:**
    - User may:
        - Move to the **next activity** (after logging or skipping)
        - Overflow time for the current activity (_in defined periods_)
        - In all cases, a **log entry is required** and goes to the activity‚Äôs `status`
- **If return is late:**
    - Prompted to log what was done
    - If needed, user can **reallocate** past time across multiple activities and write logs
- ‚è≥ Time not allocated to any activity is recorded as **dead time**

---

## ‚úÖ TODO

- [ ] üß© Allow creation of standalone activities (choose scope, project, and column) **(Must)**
- [ ] üîÅ Allow saving a column without automatically creating the next one **(Must)**
- [ ] üïê Allow tagging "dead time" with alternative labels (pause, rest, etc.) **(Must)**
- [ ] ‚ö° Quick register system for non-LPM activities
- [ ] ‚è∞ Insert reminders into activity timers (e.g., "Yoga Time")
- [ ] üåê Add multi-language support
- [ ] üß± GUI to create custom project modules (folder structures, templates, etc.)
- [ ] üéûÔ∏è UI animations for better user feedback _(Low priority)_
- [ ] Make a Docker File for ease testing.
- [ ] Make ascript or todo to explain how to install and use the plugin.
- [ ] Create a button for "import file as header" in the CreateProject flux.(would alow a lot of control to the user already)
- [ ] Make possible to link activities to repos to link commits in to activities timesspams.
